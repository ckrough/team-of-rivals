## Regulatory Evolution Patterns

### Pattern 1: Crisis → Regulation
**Timeline**: 6-24 months post-crisis
**Examples**: 
- 2008 Financial Crisis → Dodd-Frank
- Deepwater Horizon → Offshore drilling regulations
- Cambridge Analytica → GDPR enforcement

### Pattern 2: Accumulation → Regulation
**Timeline**: 3-7 years of incidents
**Examples**:
- Gig economy growth → Worker classification laws
- Data breaches → Privacy regulations
- AI development → EU AI Act

### Pattern 3: Public Pressure → Regulation
**Timeline**: 2-5 years of activism
**Examples**:
- Climate protests → Carbon pricing
- #MeToo → Workplace harassment laws
- Social media harm → Platform accountability

## Ethical Decision Frameworks

### Utilitarian Calculus

**Bentham's Hedonic Calculus Factors**:
1. Intensity: How strong is the pleasure/pain?
2. Duration: How long will it last?
3. Certainty: How likely is it?
4. Propinquity: How soon?
5. Fecundity: Will it lead to further pleasure?
6. Purity: Will it lead to pain?
7. Extent: How many affected?

### Kantian Categorical Imperatives

**First Formulation** (Universalizability):
"Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law"

**Second Formulation** (Humanity):
"Act so that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in that of another, always as an end and never merely as a means"

**Third Formulation** (Autonomy):
"Act so that your will can regard itself as making universal law through its maxims"

### Rawlsian Original Position

**Principles in Priority Order**:
1. Equal basic liberties for all
2. Equality of opportunity
3. Inequalities allowed only if benefiting worst-off (Difference Principle)

**Veil of Ignorance Questions**:
- Not knowing your race, would you approve?
- Not knowing your gender, would you approve?
- Not knowing your wealth, would you approve?
- Not knowing your ability, would you approve?
- Not knowing your generation, would you approve?

### Virtue Ethics Evaluation

**Aristotelian Virtues to Consider**:
- Courage vs Cowardice/Recklessness
- Temperance vs Insensibility/Intemperance
- Justice vs Injustice
- Prudence vs Ignorance/Cunning
- Magnanimity vs Pusillanimity/Vanity

## Trust and Reputation Dynamics

### Trust Components (Maister Formula)
```
Trust = (Credibility + Reliability + Intimacy) / Self-Orientation

Where:
- Credibility: Expertise and track record
- Reliability: Consistency and predictability
- Intimacy: Safety and comfort in relationship
- Self-Orientation: Focus on self vs other
```

### Reputation Recovery Timelines

**Minor Violation**: 6-12 months
- Single incident
- Quick acknowledgment
- Full remediation

**Moderate Violation**: 2-5 years
- Pattern of behavior
- Delayed response
- Partial remediation

**Major Violation**: 10+ years or never
- Systemic issues
- Cover-up attempted
- Insufficient response

## Second-Order Thinking Maps

### Technology Ethics Cascade

First Order: New capability released
↓
Second Order: User behavior changes
↓
Third Order: Social norms shift
↓
Fourth Order: Regulatory response
↓
Fifth Order: Industry transformation
↓
Nth Order: Civilizational change
```

### Business Model Ethics Cascade
```
First Order: Incentive structure created
↓
Second Order: Behavior optimization
↓
Third Order: Competition mimics
↓
Fourth Order: Race to bottom/top
↓
Fifth Order: Market failure/success
↓
Nth Order: Systemic change
```

## Ethical Risk Scoring

### Quantitative Ethics Score
```python
def calculate_ethics_score(decision):
    score = 100
    
    # Stakeholder impacts (-50 to +50)
    for stakeholder in decision.stakeholders:
        impact = stakeholder.benefit - stakeholder.harm
        weight = stakeholder.importance
        score += impact * weight
    
    # Time horizon adjustment
    if decision.reversible:
        score *= 1.2
    else:
        score *= 0.8
    
    # Consent factor
    if decision.has_explicit_consent:
        score *= 1.1
    elif decision.has_implicit_consent:
        score *= 1.0
    else:
        score *= 0.7
    
    # Transparency factor
    if decision.fully_transparent:
        score *= 1.2
    else:
        score *= 0.8
    
    return max(0, min(100, score))
```
