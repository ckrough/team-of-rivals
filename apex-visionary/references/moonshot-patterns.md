# Moonshot Pattern Analysis

## Transformation Patterns

### Pattern 1: Demand Creation
Create demand that doesn't exist yet by changing fundamental assumptions.

**iPhone Example**
- Before: "Phones are for calling"
- Constraint challenged: Single-purpose device
- New frame: "Computer in your pocket"
- Market creation: App economy ($100B+)

### Pattern 2: Infrastructure Inversion
Build infrastructure that makes existing infrastructure obsolete.

**AWS Example**
- Before: "Every company needs data centers"
- Constraint challenged: Physical ownership requirement
- New frame: "Computing as utility"
- Market creation: Cloud computing ($500B+)

### Pattern 3: Behavioral Arbitrage
Exploit latent behavioral changes before they're obvious.

**Uber Example**
- Before: "Strangers won't share cars"
- Constraint challenged: Trust requirements
- New frame: "Everyone's a potential driver"
- Market creation: Gig economy ($250B+)

## Constraint Analysis Framework

### Technical Constraints
- Current state: What technology allows today
- 5-year projection: What's in labs now
- 10-year projection: What physics permits
- Breakthrough scenarios: What changes everything

### Economic Constraints
- Unit economics: Current cost structure
- Scale economics: Cost at 1000x volume
- Learning curves: Cost reduction over time
- Network effects: Value multiplication

### Regulatory Constraints
- Current regulations: What's explicitly prohibited
- Gray areas: What's not yet regulated
- Jurisdiction shopping: Where to operate first
- Regulatory capture: How to shape future rules

## Market Sizing Methodology

### Bottom-Up Calculation
1. Identify smallest viable segment
2. Calculate segment value capture
3. Identify adjacent segments
4. Model expansion timeline
5. Sum total addressable market

### Top-Down Validation
1. Global economic activity in sector
2. Percentage subject to disruption
3. Platform's potential share
4. Network effect multiplier
5. New market creation factor

## Platform Evolution Stages

### Stage 1: Tool (1-2 years)
- Single use case
- Direct value creation
- Linear growth
- Competition on features

### Stage 2: Network (2-5 years)
- Multiple use cases
- User-generated value
- Exponential growth sections
- Competition on ecosystem

### Stage 3: Infrastructure (5-10 years)
- Platform for platforms
- Market maker position
- Geometric growth
- No direct competition

### Stage 4: Utility (10+ years)
- Essential service
- Regulatory moat
- Predictable growth
- Competition prevented

## Capital Deployment Strategy

### Seed: Prove Physics ($1-10M)
- Demonstrate core innovation
- Ignore unit economics
- Focus on possibility proof

### Series A-B: Prove Market ($10-100M)
- Demonstrate demand exists
- Ignore profitability
- Focus on growth rate

### Series C-D: Prove Dominance ($100M-1B)
- Demonstrate network effects
- Ignore margins
- Focus on market share

### Series E+: Prove Platform ($1B+)
- Demonstrate ecosystem value
- Consider unit economics
- Focus on switching costs

## Competitive Moat Evolution

### Initial Moat: Speed
- First mover advantage
- Rapid iteration cycles
- Customer relationship ownership

### Developing Moat: Data
- Proprietary datasets
- Algorithm training advantage
- Predictive capabilities

### Mature Moat: Network
- Multi-sided marketplace
- Ecosystem dependencies
- Standard setting power

### Ultimate Moat: Infrastructure
- Others build on your platform
- Switching costs prohibitive
- Regulatory protection
